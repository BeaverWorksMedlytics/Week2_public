# Week2_public

This repository is the PUBLIC repo for students of the 2018 MIT BWSI Medlytics course for WEEK 2.  Many notebooks do not include solutions, and instead has [# Your code here] where students should write their own code.

This repository does not allow pull requests so we recommend you fork this repository and work on your own copy.
